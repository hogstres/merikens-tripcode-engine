Meriken's Tripcode Engine
=========================

**I am currently working on a cross-platform version of this application. Donations are greatly appreciated.** 

"Meriken's Tripcode Engine" is a cross-platform application designed to generate custom/vanity tripcodes at maximum speed. 
It is arguably the fastest and most powerful program of its kind. It makes effecitive use of available computing power of CPUs and GPUs, 
and the user can specify flexible regex patterns for tripcodes. It features highly optimized, extensively parallelized 
implementations of bitslice DES and SHA-1 for OpenCL, AMD GCN, NVIDIA CUDA, and Intel SSE2/AVX/AVX2.

The Windows version of this program is available for free download here:

http://meriken.ygch.net/programming/merikens-tripcode-engine-english/

This program is part of "Meriken's Tripcode Generator," a GUI-based tripcode generator targeted primarily to users in Japan:

## Performance

Here are some actual speeds the author achieved with this tripcode generator:

* AMD Radeon HD 7990 **1022MH/s** (descrypt; 1250mV +20% 1180MHz)
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti **996MH/s** (descrypt; 110% +250MHz)
* AMD Radeon HD 290X **647M tripcode/s** (descrypt; +100mV +50% 1074MHz)
* AMD Radeon HD 7970 **408M tripcode/s** (descrypt; 1000MHz)

Currently [MTY CL][2] is the only practical alternative to this program, and this program runs much faster than MTY CL in most cases.

## Donations

I would really appreciate donations as it is quite expensive to buy hardware for testing.
I am also working on the English version of my tripcode search service and would like to add more servers.

## Building (Windows)

You need the following tools to build Meriken's Tripcode Engine.

* Visual Studio 2013 Community
* CUDA Toolkit 7.5
* AMD APP SDK 3.0
* YASM 1.2.0

This program uses Boost and Boost.Process. Make sure to extract `BoostPackages/boost_1_61_0_b1.7z` and run `BoostPackages\BuildBoostForVisualStudio.bat` before building `VisualStudio/MerikensTripcodeEngine.sln`.

There are several configurations. Please note that NVIDIA-optimized versions take **extremely** long time to build.

## Dependencies (Windows)

You need the following software installed in order to run the application:

* [AMD Radeon Desktop Video Card Driver][4]
  (if you are using an AMD graphics card)
* [NVIDIA Display Driver Version 352.78 or later][5]
  (if you are using an NVIDIA graphics card)

## Usage

Specify search patterns in `patterns.txt` and run either
`MerikensTripcodeEngine.exe`, if you are using a 32-bit operating system, or
`MerikensTripcodeEngine64.exe`, if you are using a 64-bit operating system.
Matching tripcodes will be displayed and saved in `tripcodes.txt`. See "Example of 'patterns.txt'" below.

## Building (Linux)

You need the following tools to build Meriken's Tripcode Engine.

* CMake 2.8.4 or later
* C++11-compatible compiler (g++ 5.0.0 or later)
* AMD APP SDK 3.0 (if you are using an AMD video card.)

This program uses Boost and Boost.Process. Make sure to extract `BoostPackages/boost_1_61_0_b1.7z` and build it before building `MerikensTripcodeEngine`.

# Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

```
$ cd BoostPackages
$ 7z x boost_1_61_0_b1.7z
$ cd boost_1_61_0_b1
$ ./bootstrap.sh 
$ sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev python2.7-dev 
$ ./b2 link=static runtime-link=static -j 8
$ cd ../../CMake/
$ mkdir Build
$ cd Build
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc-5 g++-5
$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-5 ..
$ make
```

## Dependencies (Linux)

You need the following software installed in order to run the application:

* AMD fglrx Driver (if you are using an AMD graphics card)

## Usage (Linux)

Specify search patterns in `patterns.txt` and run `MerikensTripcodeEngine`.
Matching tripcodes will be displayed and saved in `tripcodes.txt`.
See "Example of 'patterns.txt'" below.

## Example of "patterns.txt"

```

#
# - Specify only one pattern in each line.
# - Patterns must be at least 5 characters in length.
# - Patterns that are too long will be ignored.
# - Strings after '#' are treated as comments.



# Specify non-regex patterns after the "#noregex" directive.
# You can only use [A-Za-z0-9./] for patterns.

#noregex

TEST/                   # Matches "!TEST/UH3.F", "!TEST/ZXVew", etc.



# Specify regex patterns after the "#regex" directive.
# The following operators and specifiers are available for use:
# 
#     ^ $ () | [] [^] . + * ? \ {n} {m,n} \n
#     [:alpha:] [:upper:] [:lower:] [:digit:] [:alnum:] [:punct:]
# 
# It is encouraged to use '^' whenever possible to achieve maximum
# search speed.

#^TEST/                 # Matches "!TEST/UH3.F", "!TEST/ZXVew", etc.
#/TEST$                 # Matches "!15ycs/TEST", "!wtra5/TEST", etc.
#/TEST/                 # Matches "!y/TEST/5uj", "!anj/TEST/.", etc.

#^[Mm]eriken[:punct:]   # Matches "!meriken/u6", "!Meriken.qe", etc.



#ignore
Lines between "#ignore" are "#endignore" will be ignored.
